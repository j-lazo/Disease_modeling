# Disease_modeling
Disease models

This a simple program for disease modeling. The original purpose of this program was to test different ODE systems which intended to model the spread of diseases, with different computational solver methods. Some other features were added after. The program was written in python and its presented in a form of a GUI, the project was developed using Python 2 and PyQt4 GUI toolkit.
