# Disease_modeling
Disease models

This a simple program for disease modeling. The original purpose of this program was to test different ODE systems which intended to model the spread of diseases using different computational solver methods. Some other features were added after. The program was written in python and its presented in a form of a GUI, the project was developed using the PyQt4 GUI toolkit. The program was tested using **Python2** the implementation using python 3 wasn't tested.  

To run the program you just need to run **main.py**

The program by default has the options of a 
+ Forward Euler method
+ Runge Kutta 2nd order 
+ Runge Kutta 4th order

and the disease spreading models used were>

+ SIS Model *, **
+ SIR Model *
